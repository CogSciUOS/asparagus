abstract = "The potato (Solanunm tuberosum) is a major agricultural crop in the world and is consumed daily by millions of people from diverse cultural backgrounds. Potatoes are processed into a great variety of products, including cooked potatoes, par-fried potato strips, french fries, potato chips, potato starch, potato granules, potato flakes, and dehydrated diced potatoes, among others. The handling of potato tubers during all the steps of the production chain is of major importance since it could have a strong effect over the final quality of the potato-derived products. Potato tubers can vary tremendously in size, shape, and regularity. A product with a good appearance, size, and uniform shape will always be preferable to most consumers and will have a better sales appeal. Therefore, grading and sorting processes will ensure that the products meet defined grade and quality requirements for sellers and provide an expected level of quality for buyers. Potato quality evaluation has been done by trained human graders, but the unavailability of these inspectors has led to efforts to automate the process. Prototype automated potato inspection stations based on previously developed algorithms for shape and size have been developed and tested. There is a real need for potato analysis standardization, especially since the quality evaluation depends on the acceptance or the rejection of submitted potato batches and, of course, the subsequent payment of producers. In this sense, automation is therefore desired because it can ensure consistency in product quality and handle large volumes. A completely automated inspection station requires the incorporation of machine vision and automation into a system consisting of the appropriate hardware and software for both product handling and grading. The objective of this chapter is to present briefly how potatoes are graded automatically in the industry and which are the principal potato features and surface defects that determine the strategies one has to apply for a proper online grading."

abstract = "A computer vision system (CVS) was developed for the quality inspection of beans, based on size and color quantification of samples. The system consisted of a hardware and a software. The hardware was developed to capture a standard image from the samples. The software was coded in Matlab for segmentation, morphological operation and color quantification of the samples. For practical application of the software, a user-friendly interface was designed using Matlab graphical user interface (GUI). Length and width of the samples were determined using this system. Then the results of the system were compared to the measurements obtained by a caliper. High correlations (r=0.984 and 0.971 for length and width, respectively) were obtained between the results of the system and the caliper measurements. Moment analysis was performed to identify the beans based on their intensity distribution. Average, variance, skewness and kurtosis values were determined for each channel of RGB color format. Artificial neural networks (ANN) were used for color quantification of the samples. Samples were classified by human inspectors into five classes and twelve moment values of the 69 samples with their classes were used in the training stage of ANN. Testing of the ANN was performed with other 371 samples. The automated system was able to correctly classify 99.3% of white beans, 93.3% of yellow–green damaged beans, 69.1% of black damaged beans, 74.5% of low damaged beans and 93.8% of highly damaged beans. The overall correct classification rate obtained was 90.6%."
