# Summary of last week's work

## Classification decision tree: 
* Firs decision tree is created:
*   "Hollow" is missing.

## Research and Library
* New papers have been added to the repository. 

## Preprocessing and naming conventions
* Cut images, give everyone a label 
* Naming convention (name, ID, date, time) 
* Put each peace in a new folder with: id_number_spesific number
* New example of a naming convention: __________________
* We can create a lot of labelled artificial data from a small source.

* Integrate preprocessing into the pipeline (Ulf)
* Think of a database/table to store the characteristics of a Pic-ID.

## Label software
* Give the created images a label by adding a prefix.
* We should continue to build an interface that makes it easy for us to label data ourselves.

## Service
* The service was tested on the machine. However, the machine will output an error because it is trying to access the directly moving images.
* It is possible to start and stop the service by pressing the Windows key + enter "Service" and open the window. Search for Directory Check and use the GUI.


## Team Viewer
* plan to manually collect and move images using the Google Calendar.

# During the meeting
* We had a discussion about how to use git. It will be finished.
