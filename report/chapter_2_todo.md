# Report chapter 2:&ensp;Data acquisition and organization
Here, you can find an overview of how to contribute to chapter 2 of our report, copy & pasted from the report, so you do not need to create a pdf from the .tex files.    
    
> ## 2&ensp;Data acquisition and organization  
>  
> &ensp; **Timetable (roadmap) of the project**     
>     
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; A (visual) overview of the project's course during the year. `Josefine`  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; How we planned the project vs. how the actual timetable of the project looked like.  
>  
> &ensp; **Organisation of the study group**  
>  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Communication  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Deciding on a communication platform and handling it: organization in general, team meetings,   
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Asana, Telegram, and any other virtual form of communication  
>  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Teamwork  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; The experience of working in a team and organising/distributing tasks in a group:  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; task distribution, cooperation on tasks, GitHub: organising our project with Git,  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Grid: working together with the IKW data store, other teamwork related experiences  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; (could we integrate the strengths and weaknesses of the single team members) ...  
>  
> &ensp; **Data Collection**  `Josefine`  
>  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; How we collected the data and what the data looked like.  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Here, the process of driving to Rheine and collecting the data with an external hard-drive is described.  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Understanding the sorting machine and its output.  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; First problems that had to be resolved: labeled vs. unlabeled data ( -> running pre-sorted pieces  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; through the sorting machine, did not (completely) resolve our problem), saving the data manually  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; on an external harddrive ( -> solved by building a script for data transfer, and Teamviewer sessions)  
>  
> &ensp; **Literature research**  `Josefine`  
>  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Previous literature research concerning food classification and handling unlabeled data.  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Searching for background literature close to our project, e.g. automatic CV-based sorting of other  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; food products.  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Researching semi-supervised and unsupervised learning approaches.  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Re-reading on potential ANN structures that we could use for sorting.  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; What was the result?  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Could we rely on a certain paper/process? Did it work?
