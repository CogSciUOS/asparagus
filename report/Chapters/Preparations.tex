\section{Data acquisition and organization}

Organizing a working schedule for the year, collecting the data, and literature research.

\subsection{Timetable (roadmap) of the project}

A (visual) overview of the projectâ€™s course during the year: \\
a) how we planned the project, vs. \\
b) how the actual timetable of the project looked like.

\subsection{Organisation of the study group}

Deciding on a working/communication platform and handling it: \\
a) GitHub: organising a project with Git \\
b) Grid: working with the IKW data storage \\
c) Asana, Telegram, and any other form of communication \\
\\
Further, any meetings, the task distributions, and other team work related experiences are included here.

\subsection{Data collection}

How we collected the data and what the data looked like. Understanding the sorting machine and its output. \\
First problems that had to be resolved: \\
a) labeled vs. unlabeled data (partly resolved by running pre-sorted pieces through the sorting machine) and \\
b) saving the data manually on an external harddrive (solved by buildin a script for data transfer and Teamviewer sessions)

\subsection{Literature research}

Searching for background literature close to our project, e.g. automatic CV-based sorting of other food products. \\
Researching semi-supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. \\
Re-reading on potential ANN structures that we could use for sorting. \\
What was the result? Did we rely on a certain paper/process? Did it work?
