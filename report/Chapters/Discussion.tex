\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Comparison of neural networks}

Comparing the results of the different networks. Which approach worked best?

\subsection{Final result of the project}


\subsubsection{Scientific results}

Short summary of the project and its outcome on a scientific basis. \\
What did we achieve in the end? \\
What went well and what did not work so well? \\
What would we do differently if we could start anew, what would we keep? \\
What problems did we run into and how did we solve them? \\
Were there any technical restrictions?

\subsubsection{Organization}

Short summary of the project as a study project and teamwork experience. \\
How did the organisation work? \\
What did we achieve in the end? \\
What went well and what did not work so well? \\
What would we do differently if we could start anew, what would we keep? \\
What problems did we run into and how did we solve them?

\subsection{Next steps}

Further outlook of the project. \\
How could the project continue? \\
How do its findings contribute to the ANN landscape/ open science, e.g. could we publish the dataset?
