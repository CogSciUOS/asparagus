%	PREPROCESSING PIPELINE AND DATASET CREATION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Preparing the dataset}

Different preprocessing steps of the data and deciding how the data should/will look like. The label app is introduced and the process of manually labeling a part of the data, with a description of the criteria. Finally, the dataset is introduced.

\subsection{Preprocessing steps}

First approach to create a dataset (layout) and data augmentation to generate more samples. \\
Background removal of the collected images. \\
First approach to create an automatic feature extraction pipeline (sorting for features, not labels). \\
Preparing the samples (3 pictures per asparagus) for manual classification to create more labeled data.

\subsection{The hand-label assistant}

Introduction to the script created for manual asparagus sorting. Fusion of single feature extraction scripts and explanation of any additional code needed. \\
User manual for the app and introduction to its GUI. \\
Installation of the app (environment setup, mount points, problems we ran into, etc.). \\
How well did the feature extraction work? How much had to be labeled by hand? What is the output of the app?


\subsection{Manual labeling}

Sorting criteria explained in detail for the hand-labeling of features with the app. \\ Sorting outcome: \\
a) How much did we sort? \\
b) How well did the sorting work in general, i.e. was it easy to sort, how long did it take, what problems were encountered, ... ? \\
c) How accurately did we sort as a group? (i.e. Kappa Agreement)

\subsection{The asparagus dataset}

Structural information of the dataset. \\
What does it look like? \\
How big is it (labeled vs unlabeled samples)? \\
What were the challenges in its creation?
