%	CLASSIFICATION OF DATA VIA DIFFERENT METHODS
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Classification}

Classification of the data using different approaches.

\subsection{Supervised learning}

Convolutional neural networks created to sort the samples for their features.

\subsubsection{Single-label classification}

Single-label approach, where the network sorts for one feature. \\
Why did we choose this approach? How was the network created? Which obstacles did occur?\\
What was the result?

\subsubsection{Multilabel classification}

Multilabel approach, where the network labels everything at the same time. \\
Why did we choose this approach? How was the network created? Which obstacles did occur?\\ What was the result?

\subsection{Semi-supervised learning}

Train a network on labeled and unlabeled samples, using an autoencoder. \\
Why did we choose this approach? How was the network created? Which obstacles did occur?\\ What was the result?

\subsection{Unsupervised learning}

Unsupervised approach to sort the asparagus by using principal component analysis. \\
Why did we choose this approach? How was the network created? Which obstacles did occur?\\ What was the result?

\subsection{From feature to label}

Linking the features to their designated label. \\
Combining the outcome of multiple networks for further processing.
