Task distributions are marked `like this`. It indicates where you can write about your model/approach.  
  
In the following, it is described which scheme to follow and which questions you should answer when writing about your approach.
  
## Describing your model:
INTRODUCTION
- 2-3 introductory sentences ( e.g., One supervised approach for training a model is xxx. It uses xxx and works like xxx.)
- What approach did I choose? (short)
- Why did I choose it? (What are the advantages/disadvantages of the model/ap- proach? What results do I expect?) (short)
