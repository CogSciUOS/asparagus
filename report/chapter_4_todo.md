# Chapter 4:&ensp;Classification
Here, you can find a guideline of how to contribute to chapter 4 of our report. In chapter 4, we will discuss each approach we chose to investigate our data, train our models, etc.  
  
This is the overview of Chapter 4 of the Report:

Task distributions are marked `like this`. It indicates where you can write about your model/approach.  
  
In the following, it is described which scheme to follow and which questions you should answer when writing about your approach.
Your text should be  
* ~2-3 pages long (excluding figures)
* the more details, however, the better because this chapter is one of the most interesting to our supervisors
* do not include any code, except it really is necessary for explanatory purposes (code will be in our Github repo which Ulf and Axel will inspect); however, it is always good to refer to the directory etc. where to find what you are talking about 
*
  
In general, try to follow the 'bottleneck approach' which is to start every paragraph or part of your text with an introduction what you are going to describe. When you are done with the part, finish with a wrap-up where you summarise what you did.
  
## Describing your model:
INTRODUCTION
* you should include 2-3 introductory sentences as a starter, summarizing your apporach( e.g., One supervised approach for training a model is xxx. It uses xxx and works like xxx.)
* What approach did I choose? (keep it short)
- Why did I choose it? (What are the advantages/disadvantages of the model/ap- proach? What results do I expect?) (short)
