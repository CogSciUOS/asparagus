> &ensp; **Background on computer vision based classification tasks**  `Josefine`  
>   
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Short introduction into the field of computer vision and short introduction to artificial neural networks. Prospects > &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; and challenges of both on a general basis.  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; This part is kept very brief.

> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Including the decision tree for the labels as sorted with Silvanâ€™s machine.  
>   
> &ensp; **Expected outcome vs. actual outcome of the project**  
>
