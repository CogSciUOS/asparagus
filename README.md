# Asparagus classification project


We are a study project of Osnabrueck University that is interested in Computer Vision.
With this project we want to improve the performance of an asparagus sorting machine.

The repository shows how we classify images of asparagus with Machine Learning methods.
We also developed an app to manually label the asparagus images.

Have a look at our [documentation](https://asparagus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)!
