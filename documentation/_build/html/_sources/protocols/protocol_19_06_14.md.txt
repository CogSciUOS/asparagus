# Friday, June 14, 2019 (Planning of last days of data collection, Subgroup divisions)

Participants: Luana, Maren, Malin, Sophia, Richard, Josefine, Axel, Ulf  


## Updates

## Labelled Data

How many (labelled) pictures do we need?
-	we don’t always have all asparagus classes (not evenly distributed)
-	only one week left
-	having more data won’t hurt
-	what fraction of data might be labelled? (prob. less than 10%)
-	semi supervised learning techniques might recommend how much labelled data we need

Schedule for trips to Rheine to collect labelled data
-	Monday 17.06 : Richard, Josefine
-	Tuesday 18.06 : Sophia, Luana
-	Wednesday 19.06 : Richard, Malin
-	Thursday 20.06 : Maren, Luana
-	Friday 21.06 : Sophia, Josefine
-	still open: 14., 15., 16. &  22., 23.

## Problems and Thoughts

Ideas of bucket-wise collection
-	don’t think about perfect classification piecewise but bucketwise
-	find solution for problem, that even sorted asparagus is sorted by human eye and not perfect as the machine would need to learn the classes
-	use a system where you update while classifying
-	apply this idea to features and not images

After data collection
-	have subgroups with smaller tasks
-	try all sorts of possibilities for sorting (ANN etc.)

Curvature extraction
-	actual asparagus sometimes S-shaped, bump at end etc.
-	method should be able to detect different kinds of curvature (return all asparagus that is not totally straight as curved)

User interface design
-	how should the user interact and also influence the sorting-process?
-	if people here are interested in this, we include it (but it is no must)
-	maybe difficult to say right now while we do not have an algorithm or anything yet
-	decision postponed to later date

## Subgroups

Decision app
-	Michael
-	gives some information on the shown asparagus picture
-	has only yes and no buttons

Documentation
-	Katha
-	(gather more literature)

Feature extraction
-	flower, color and maybe rust still problematic
-	

Framework
-	already start it and then implement it as soon as feature extraction is done

Literature research
-	rather a task distributed to all subgroups

Organisatorial stuff
-	don’t have too many subgroups
-	distribute groups and the assign more than one task to them

Report
-	already start the report on our study project
-	not only write what we have done but also why we tried it (make this very clear why we thought this is a good idea), how we arrived there and also put in what failed
-	generally good: before you start something, write down what you expect/plan to gain from it and always update what worked and what didn’t
-	around 100 pages expected, 10 pages per person (no final number)

## Next week
 Presentations
-	data augmentation
-	semi-supervised learning
