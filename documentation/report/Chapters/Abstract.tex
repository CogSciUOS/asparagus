\label{Abstract}

In the agricultural industry, the process of sorting food products into different quality classes is nowadays primarily achieved through sorting machines using classical, rule-based methods. One food product with many possible quality classes is white asparagus.

In this project, our team tackles the issue of asparagus classification by exploring different classical and state of the art machine learning and computer vision techniques. For this purpose, a range of supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning approaches are tested and evaluated. The data set is based on the output of the asparagus sorting machine Autoselect ATS II, which uses image data for classification. The result of the project shows that different approaches are suitable for solving the issue. For comparison with classical methods used in the industry and to provide a practical application, further testing of the approaches is needed.
