Attendants: Ulf, Axel, Malin, Luana, Michael, Josefine, Sophia, Thomas, Maren

# Summary about visit to Rheine
(Sophia and Thomas went)
* Collected labeled data
* measured distance camera to band (~60 cm), and asparagus width
* service to move images to harddrive works

## Problems
* Service to move the images leads to an error that stops the machine
* to upload pictures directly to the university server is limited by speed of GPU, Internet, or external harddrive
* compressing the images to jpag rather than zip could be faster

# To our work
*	we should start compressing the pictures
* preprocessed images are sufficently smaller

# The Hermelerguy
* he is interested in a cooperation with us (could provide a newer machine and camera) - "feels like a profit making person"
* How could we benefit from the Hermelerguy?
  * probably he has labeled data, that he is not willing to give without cooperation
  * a lot of knowledge how the machine works
  * get some alternative data, that could improve our results (2 datasets) or get some new data, to make some variance (could maybe then be used for other machines?)
  * get the API (holy grail) of the machine
  * we want to improve the old machine, rather than a new one

# Organisatorial
*	internal work party at the asparagusfarm at the 18.05.19, 7 pm (BBQ and drinks are provided)
*	We can use the room, where we met the first week (50/228 ?), we are going to apply for a transponder but for now we can just ask Ulf/Axel to open
* We will (try) start using Asana from now on

# Next steps
* Prepare a meeting with the Hermelerguy:
  * possible invitation 24.05.19
  * presentation: who are we, what are we doing, what did we already do, what do we want to archive (slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EO0M33C2WHCRcTHvgkIY2ezVKcoGBmP9NbNafQ2zRKk/edit?usp=sharing)
  * collect questions
  * collect topics, that we avoid!!!1elf!!
  * contact the software company, to get connected
* start compressing the pictures

# For next meeting (17.05.19)
*	Everybody should present one classification architecture in the Deep learning class (sign up in Asana, presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fsgr7jhZ5YtJWwOv8TSN4qxvsZwf2KRwoQQdKJv-gnM/edit?usp=sharing)
  * how they are related to our task (qualification/disqualification)
* plan another trip to Rheine to collect labeled data
