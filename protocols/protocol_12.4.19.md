Seccond Session: Monday, April 12, 2019

Attendants: Ulf, Axel, Richard, Malin, Luana, Maren, Josefine, Katharina, Sophia, Subir, Thomas, Michael 

# Summary about visit to Rheine
(Sophia, Thomas and Richard went)
* Pictures can be stored internally on computer, later moved to harddrive
* Problem with putting asparagus through the machine twice (for the whole data set), therefore we will only get labeled data if one of us goes there and does the work
* we easily ge unlabeled data – we can manually label it ourselves, maybe we can do “decision tree”
* at one day, we already got ~35.000 unlabeled pictures

### to machine: 
* in machine 13 values saved
* maybe possible to move knife in machine? 
* it seems that it is possible to save the label which the machine puts on it
* if we can use all values by machine, maybe we don’t even have to use deep learning, but classical methods 
* we can change speed of machine (up to a min. speed)
* currently 14 categories to sort asparagus

# To our work
*	we should compare deep learning (convolutional neural nets) with classical machine learning methods (the net can't be too deep, because the machine has to be fast)
*	idea: self-supervised learning / semi-supervised learning (= some labeled data)
* important for sorting:hierarchical division in categories(40-50% of first category)
* Richard found code to watch folders and move files

# Organisatiorial
*	Do we want to use Trello, Asana or other program to organize ourselves?
*	We have here at the IKW computers to where we can store all images

# Next steps
-	we need to make description for categories, table of classes + visual description
-	we should build an interface which makes it easy for us to label data ourselves
-	maybe we want to call people from machine/ call company to get labeled data & more information?
-	Everybody should have a look on images/ some data, look at some open cv, try out to apply classical cv methods, get involved and a feeling for the data, what open libraries are out there which we can use? 

# For next meeting (26.4.)
-	Everybody should present one way how to work with the data
-	Everybody takes one paper & looks what they have done & present it
- Call Geschäftsstelle (Beate Eibisch)/ Raumverwaltung to ask for a room (get transponders to computer room?)

-	Luana will present Asana
-	Thomas will edit everyone to GitHub
-	Malin makes a doodle when to go to Rheine (24.4., 25.4. or 26.4.  https://doodle.com/poll/8bsmthcz9ddu48ci )
-	Ulf ask room for computer visison (only next week) – if it dosnt work Katharina will ask
-	Richard writes service
-	Sophia, Luana look at pictures
-	Josefine, Katha, Michael – look at papers
- maybe we additionally meet Thursday 18.4. at 12:00pm to prepare field trip
