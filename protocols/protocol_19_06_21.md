    --> look at the **timestamp in the filename**
- Example: G01-190411-092055-873_F00.bmp
  - This picture is the first (F00) of three images (F00, F01, F02) (do not rely on this!)
  - G01: (?)
  - 190411: 11th April 2019

## Data Augmentation and Single Image Super-Resolution

@Luana, please put the Link to Asana and maybe a summary here.



## Visit to Querdel

- 6000 images unlabeled (few category flower, category normal)
- 5 persons working on the machine (3 people resorting)
- quality of head images is much better
- the light set up is better (less reflections)
- still not sure if we can make use of the images
