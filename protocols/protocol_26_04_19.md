# Excursion Today

Organisatorial Stuff
-	where:
-	when:
-	Katha has a car
-	Michael has a car (can go after 15h)

# What do we want to do?
-	collect more data (take hard drive with us)
-	installing Richards tool
-	talk to Sophia’s brother again to explain
-	maybe try to get some labelled data
-	we still need the list of categories (which could be acquired once we’re there)

Project Management Tools

Presentation:
-	Trello	
-	ClickUp
-	Asana
-	Google Drive		

Vote for system: Asana (no strong opinion)

Github
-	also has a project management system
-	we would not need another user account
-	university server can be used for file/image storage
-	foldr “Asparagus”
-	when creating a folder, give access to other group members
-	pathway: net/projects/scratch/summer/valid_until_31_January_2020/asparagus

New vote on choosing Github for now
-	if it is not to our liking after two weeks we will use Asana

Github Project “Asparagus
-	we will use other projects for (smaller) tasks

Paper Presentation

-	image acquisition
o	illumination
-	small subset of labelled data
o	key word: semisupervised learning
o	autoencoders
-	other papers found:
o	flower classification
o	non-labelled images
o	feature extraction

Usefulness of having a collection of papers

Open discussion

-	little less than two months for image acquisition
-	image acquisition might be most important part right now
o	check illumination? – illumination should be fine

3 remarks by Ulf Krumnack
-	looking at literature is always good
-	give pros and cons for rating of paper
-	now we should focus on data acquisition (not focus on going too eep into methods right now)
-	for future: should definitely have look at working with unbalanced datasets, because most other papers work with balanced data sets

Vote for list of papers
-	keep it (8)
-	no use (1)

Usage of markdown in Github

To Do list for next session:
-	presentation by Thomas about playing with pictures
o	cut image into 3 parts to have one piece of asparagus per picture
o	filter out background (find a bounding box around asparagus
o	work on preprocessing steps)
o	reducing file size (right now it is 5 GB)
o	goal: have images that all look the same (right now there is sometimes one asparagus, sometimes 3 etc) and are small enough
o	have distinct bright background (to have no confusion with dirt/purple asparagus/ dark, rusty stains
-	if we have labelled data, it would be good to have a folder for each category
o	watch out for naming conventions (to avoid double naming/overcomplicated names)
-	program on machine
o	can store features of images, date etc.
o	on screen seems it did well with borders etc.
o	question is: why is the machine so bad, if the features look so well
•	 if the features are bad we need new ones
•	but if the features are good it woud make the task so much easier because we could just use their features
•	most difficult one seemed colouring
-	have a look at grid again
-	maybe also have a small github tutorial
-	you can have a look at the code of the service on github
-	github & grid meeting after regular Friday morning meeting
-	for next week: talk about github branching, naming conventions
-	next week after regular meeting: have a github workflow session
-	task Sophia: try to figure out how this machine program works to get their feature selection; and which they select
-	Malin: reading up on implementing pictures; preprocessing papers and beginning implementation
-	Richard: start to implement algorithms he learned on lectures
-	think about guideline for classification (sheet of paper)
o	have a code for sorting pictures in different categories
-	look at unbalanced data sets (data set augmentation) and maybe semi supervised
-	Josefine: have a sheet with classification instructions (?); which steps/categories; best if it is the same as the machine
