Seccond Session: Monday, April 12, 2019

Attendants: Ulf, Axel, Richard, Malin, Luana, Maren, Josefine, Katharina, Sophia, Subir, Thomas, Michael 

# Summary about visit to Rheine
(Sophia, Thomas and Richard went)
* Pictures can be stored internally on computer, later moved to harddrive
* Problem with putting asparagus through the machine twice (for the whole data set); if one of us would go there and do the work we can get a smaller data seta
 if we get unlabeled data – we can manually label it ourselves, maybe we can do “decision tree”
* Possible to move knife in machine? 
* in machine 13 values saved in machine
* it seems that it is possible to save the label which the machine puts on it
* if we can use all values by machine, maybe we don’t even have to use deep learning, but classical methods 
* we can change speed of machine (up to a min. speed)
* currently 14 labels
* Richard found code to watch folders and move files

# To our work
*	we should compare deep learning (convolutional neural nets) with classical machine learning methods 
*	the net can`t be too deep, because the machine has to be fast
*	idea: self-supervised learning / semi-supervised learning (= some labeled data)
* important for sorting:hierarchical division in categories(40-50% of first category)

# Organisatiorial
*	Trello, Asana or other program to organize ourselves?
*	We have here computers to store all images

# Next steps
-	we need description for categories, table of classes + visual description
-	label our data ourselves
-	we should build an interface which makes it easy for us to label
-	call people from machine/ call company?
-	Everybody should have a look on images/ some data – look at some open cv – try out to apply classical cv methods, get involved and a feeling for the data, what libraries are there? 
-	Everybody should present one way how to work with the data
-	Everybody takes one paper & looks what they have done & present it

# For next meeting
-	Luana will present Asana
-	Call Geschäftsstelle (Beate Eibisch)/ Raumverwaltung to ask for a room, right to get transponders to computer room
-	Thomas will edit everyone to GitHub
-	Malin makes a doodle 
-	Ulf ask room for computer visison (only next week) – if it dosnt work Katha will ask
-	Richard writes service
-	Sophia, Luana look at pictures
-	Josefine, Katha, ? – look at papers


Shall we meet Thursday 18.4.?
