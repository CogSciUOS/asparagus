# Protocol 17.5.19

Participants: Thomas, Richard, Subir, Michael, Katharina, Josefine, Sophia, Maren, Malin, Ulf and Axel

Topics of today: 

- summary from last week

## Preparations for meeting with man from Hermerle next Friday (24.5.)

    (he is open for cooperation, we will see if we can make use of it)

### presentation for him
(Thomas has further notes to this)

    presentation (~10min):
    - intro what our backgrounds are/ cognitive science
    - intro to study project : what we are interested in  - methodology —> came to idea to apply it to machine of sophia's brother 
    - classes what we want to sort --> include picture of decision tree which Josefine draw
    - explain our toolbox - state openness to other methods
    - share extraction of pictures, which Thomas already did

    questions to ask him:
    (more questions should be added)
    - what exactly is he doing (how is he adjusting the machine) when he is at Rheine?
    - do more farms have the same machine? 
    - what are we not allowed to do with the machine? 
    - what is he currently doing, software wise - current methods - on new machines? 
    - is the machine bad because of hardware or because of software problem? 
    - is he willing to help us to integrate a new software on old machine?
    - is there a prior integrated? 
    - what is the bucket full behaviour of the machine? 
    - question about demo version - (what didn’t work when Thomas and Sophia went to Rheine last time)
    - ask him if we can get software QV

- thomas, josefine & Sophia feel responsible to prepare slides
- Sophia & Michael will hold presentation
- split up questions ?  - distribute it with asana or before the meeting
- maren takes care of coffee & cookies


    - more precise definition of tasks for the next weeks so that its easier to assign oneself to tasks
        - get algorithmic baseline - extract features manually 
            - simple python functions: takes an image and extracts  thickness / width, rusty, length, color, curvature …
                - preprocess_images(path, outpath)
                - extract_width(preprocessed_image, num_measurements = 5):  return List_of_Width - Sophia
                - horizontal_slices(preprocessed_image, num_measurements) begin_end_matrix - Sophia
                - extract_curvature(preprocessed_image): curvature score -  Maren
                - check_rust(preprocessed_image): score_of_certainty - Michael
                - check_violet(preprocessed_image): score_of_certainty - Subir
                - check_flower(preprossed_image): score_of_certainty - Richard, Katha
                - extract_length(preprocessed_image): length - Malin

        - human classification - labelling of data
        - non programming tasks: 
            - classification with hirarchical classes
            - working with unbalanced classes
            - semi-supervised learning
